A webpack plugin acting as an interface to
[Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/cli/).

### Installation

Using npm:

```
$ npm install @sentry/webpack-plugin --only=dev
```

Using yarn:

```
$ yarn add @sentry/webpack-plugin --dev
```

### CLI Configuration

You can use either `.sentryclirc` file or ENV variables described here
https://docs.sentry.io/learn/cli/configuration/

### Usage

```js
const SentryCliPlugin = require('@sentry/webpack-plugin');

const config = {
  plugins: [
    new SentryCliPlugin({
      include: '.',
      ignoreFile: '.sentrycliignore',
      ignore: ['node_modules', 'webpack.config.js'],
      configFile: 'sentry.properties',
    }),
  ],
};
```

Also, check the [example](example) directory.

#### Options

* `release [optional]` - unique name of a release, must be a `string`, should
  uniquely identify your release, defaults to
  `sentry-cli releases propose-version` command which should always return the
  correct version (**requires access to `git` CLI and root directory to be a valid
  repository**).
* `include [required]` - `string` or `array`, one or more paths that Sentry CLI
  should scan recursively for sources. It will upload all `.map` files and match
  associated `.js` files
* `entries [optional]` - `array` or `RegExp` or `function(key: string): bool`, a
  filter for entry points that should be processed. By default, the release will
  be injected into all entry points.
* `ignoreFile [optional]` - `string`, path to a file containing list of
  files/directories to ignore. Can point to `.gitignore` or anything with same
  format
* `ignore [optional]` - `string` or `array`, one or more paths to ignore during
  upload. Overrides entries in `ignoreFile` file. If neither `ignoreFile` or
  `ignore` are present, defaults to `['node_modules']`
* `configFile [optional]` - `string`, path to Sentry CLI config properties, as
  described in https://docs.sentry.io/learn/cli/configuration/#properties-files.
  By default, the config file is looked for upwards from the current path and
  defaults from `~/.sentryclirc` are always loaded
* `ext [optional]` - `array`, this sets the file extensions to be
  considered. By default the following file extensions are processed: js, map,
  jsbundle and bundle.
* `urlPrefix [optional]` - `string`, this sets an URL prefix at the beginning
  of all files. This defaults to `~/` but you might want to set this to the
  full URL. This is also useful if your files are stored in a sub folder. eg:
  `url-prefix '~/static/js'`
* `urlSuffix [optional]` - `string`, this sets an URL suffix at the end of all
  files. Useful for appending query parameters.
* `validate [optional]` - `boolean`, this attempts sourcemap validation before
  upload when rewriting is not enabled. It will spot a variety of issues with
  source maps and cancel the upload if any are found. This is not the default as
  this can cause false positives.
* `stripPrefix [optional]` - `array`, when paired with `rewrite` this will
  chop-off a prefix from uploaded files. For instance you can use this to remove
  a path that is build machine specific.
* `stripCommonPrefix [optional]` - `boolean`, when paired with `rewrite` this
  will add `~` to the `stripPrefix` array.
* `sourceMapReference [optional]` - `boolean`, this prevents the automatic
  detection of sourcemap references.
* `rewrite [optional]` - `boolean`, enables rewriting of matching sourcemaps so
  that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible.,
  defaults to `true`
* `dryRun [optional]` - `boolean`, attempts a dry run (useful for dev
  environments)
* `debug [optional]` - `boolean`, print some useful debug information
* `silent [optional]` - `boolean`, if `true`, all logs are suppressed (useful for `--json` option)
